      <p>A master archer allied with Rogers;[6][7] a retired Avenger and S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.[13][33] On Barton's reasons
        for joining Rogers' side, Renner said, "Cap was the first guy who called. Let's just get the job done so I can
        get home to the family,"[30] along with feeling an obligation to side with Scarlet Witch, since her brother,
        Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver, sacrificed himself to save Barton in Avengers: Age of Ultron.[34] On how he and
        Barton fit into the Marvel Cinematic Universe, Renner said, "I'm happy to be the ensemble. I'm not scratching or
        clawing to do a solo movie by any means ... I think [Barton's] a utility guy that can bounce around into other
        people's universes a little bit".[35]</p>

        She's doing all the work. She doesn't have the kind of manpower that she had in S.H.I.E.L.D.,"[51] instead
        working for Tony Stark at the Avenger's headquarters "trying to keep everything running as smoothly as
        possible... it's an entirely different vibe for her."[52]</p>

      <h2>Nick Fury</h2>
      <p>The future director of S.H.I.E.L.D., who at this time is a low-level bureaucrat.[21] Fury appears without his
        signature eye patch as the film is set before he loses his eye.[22] Feige explained that Danvers is the first
        superhero that Fury has come across,[23] which sets him on a path to where the character is in the modern MCU
        films.[24] Jackson described Fury at this point in time as a desk jockey, who has not yet become cynical towards
        bureaucracy and who learns in the film that there are superpowered beings who could help S.H.I.E.L.D.'s
        cause.[25] Jackson added that trusting Danvers plays a key role in his development, as they become "compatriots"
        over the course of the film.[26] Jackson was digitally de-aged by 25 years, the first time Marvel has done this
        for an entire film.[27]</p>

      <h2>Phil Coulson</h2>
      <p>A rookie agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. who works closely with Fury.[21] Gregg stated that Coulson would be younger in
        the film and "a bit of a new guy in S.H.I.E.L.D. ... It's the earliest we will have seen him [in the MCU], so
        when he says, 'Mr. Stark, this isn't my first rodeo' in Iron Man (2008), this is maybe the rodeo he's talking
        about."[39] He felt "there was something really special about going back to the early days when [Coulson] was
        just kind of coming up the ranks" and had to work to portray Coulson "a little less crusty and jaded" as he is
        in the present of the MCU.[21] Responding to the fact that Coulson has encountered the Kree on the MCU
        television series, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Schwartz stated that in Captain Marvel, Kree is not even "part of his
        vocabulary yet", and the film gets "to focus on him as he is so we don't need to worry about the stuff he's
        going to encounter later".[40] Like Jackson, Gregg was digitally de-aged by 25 years.[27]</p>

        Avengers: Infinity War, Evans agreed to appear in the film "because it made sense. It's going to wrap everything
